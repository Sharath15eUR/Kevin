Q9)

The "ip link" command can help us to manage the network interfaces connected to our machine.

i) ip link set : this command allows us to set the status of any network interfaces connected to UP or DOWN, change the TYPE, MULTICAST on or off, PROMISCUOUS on or off, etc.
ii) ip link add : this command allows us to add a new network interface to our device.
iii) ip link deleta : deletes/removes the network interface from our device

Other than these subcommands, there are various uses of ip link which can further help us to configure a LAN network.
