Q2)

From the attached screenshots, we have generated traffic using ping command and pinging from attached network device to the router. 

Source IP: 192.168.0.117
Destination IP: 192.168.0.1

Ethernet frame analysis:

Destination: This is the MAC address of the destination the packet is transmitting to.
Source: This is the MAC address of the source of the packet.

From the iwconfig output, we can see that the network device and the source have the same MAC address, which means this packet is being sent by the network device.

Ethertype: IPv4 (ICMP)

Payload: It is the data contents of the packet.
