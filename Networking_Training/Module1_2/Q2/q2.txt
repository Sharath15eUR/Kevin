Q2. Hosting a FTP and SFTP server and using PUT and GET commands

First, we will have to install vsftpd,ftp and ufw in our server (guest VM):
  sudo apt install vsftpd ftp ufw

SFTP:
First, we login to the SFTP server using the command
	sftp ftpuser@192.168.56.102

where, 192.168.56.102 is the ip address of the server and ftpuser is the user present in the server, where the files will be stored

Then, we can use the PUT command to send a file from local machine to the server <refer attached image>

To get a file from the server to the local machine, we can use the GET command <refer attached image>

FTP:
The above same commands can be replicated by also using a FTP server. The command to connect to an FTP server is:
	ftp ftpuser@192.168.56.102
