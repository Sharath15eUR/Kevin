Q5) What is the difference between bridge mode and repeater mode?

Repeater mode : This mode makes the router act as a repeater. It means that the repeater router connected to the main router receives the signal from it, amplifies it, and broadcasts the amplified signal to the 
devices connected to the repeater router.

Bridge mode : This mode makes the router lose it's additional propertles like NAT, DHCP, etc. It acts as a simple bridge that only transmits the received data to the desired destination MAC address, if the address is known. If
not known, it will broadcast the message to all the connected devices.
