Q8) Difference between WFA and IEEE.

IEEE stands for Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. IEEE is responsible for developing the technical standards like IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n. These are theoretical
and provides the manufacturers a blueprint as to how the product should work. 

WFA stands for WiFi Alliance. This organization is responsible for testing and certifying various products and ensure that the said products follow the IEEE standards. This
is done so that all the certified products from different brands can work with each other in a network reliably.
