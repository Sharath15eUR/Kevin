A backhaul refers to the connection/link between the internet and smaller subnetworks (like home WLAN).
There are mainly two types:
1) Wired
2) Wireless

Wired:
  1) Fiber optics - High data rate and low latency but with high cost.
  2) Copper Cables - Comparitively lower data rate but cheaper. Is also older technology.

Wireless:
  1) Microwave - Uses radio waves to transmit data wirelessly.
  2) mmWave - Operates on higher frequencies, resulting in higher speed.
  3) Satellite - Useful for rural and remote areas where it is not possible to setup other wired/wireless networks. Has higher latency compared to microwave and mmwave.

My college mainly uses Wired backhaul (fiber optics and copper cables) for the lab and office systems, while for general purpose usage like student wifi, wireless backhauls are used.
